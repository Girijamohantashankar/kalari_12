            <h1>KALARIPAYATTU</h1>
            <p>Kalari has influenced not only Asian martials arts like Karate and Kung Fu but many others, too, like
                Judo and Jiu Jitsu!</p>
            <p>Ancient Indian Warriors, men and women alike, practiced bare hand and weapon combat techniques as part of
                Kalaripayattu.</p>
            <p>But little do people know that the ultimate focus of this ancient practice is a perfect connection
                between the mind, body and soul.</p>
            <p>Everyone seems to share the belief that Kalari is primarily a martial art...</p>
            <p>But here's the truth...</p>

            <h1>Kalari is not just a martial art.
                It's something much bigger!</h1>
            <p>The majority of Kalari instructors and practitioners are unaware of the true capabilities of Kalari. </p>
            <p>They either don't know or choose not to reveal its full potential and its transformative power.</p>
            <p><strong>The Kalari Way of Life has the power to relieve stress, heal chronic ailments and enhance
                    productivity in today’s day and age.</strong></p>

            <h2>It's time to reveal the secrets and show you what Kalari truly is…</h2>

        <div class="left_text">
            <b>HI THERE!</b>
            <h1>My name is Raphael</h1>
            <p>And this is me with my brother, Paulus during our time in India.</p>
            <p><b>As a child, I wasn't into sports, I got sick often, and I felt mentally weak. </b></p>
            <p><b>However, deep down, I believed that somewhere out there was a way to unlock some secret powers within
                    me.</b></p>
            <p>In 2012, I discovered the path that finally allowed me to tap into my hidden potential.</p>
            <h3 class="UNEXPECTED"><b>MY LIFE TOOK AN UNEXPECTED TURN WHEN</b></h3>
            <h1>I Was Introduced to Kalari</h1>
            <p style="color: rgb(92, 89, 89);">I arrived in India seeking a glimpse of an ancient healing method called
                “Kalari Chikilsa”.</p>
            <p style="color: rgb(92, 89, 89);">Learning the martial art associated with it didn't interest me, as I had
                seen how challenging the training could be. <b style="color: black;">I wasn't tough and wanted to avoid
                    any injuries.</b></p>
            <p style="color: rgb(92, 89, 89);">While most students focused solely on mastering Kalaripayattu - the
                oldest martial art in the world, my journey was different. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box_text_content">
            <h2>My intention was not to fight or defend myself. <br>
                My motivation was to experience an increase in my energy level.</h2>
            <h2>Encouraged by our master, I not only learned the healing art but also practiced <br>the martial art.
            </h2>
        </div>
        <p class="game">AND IT WAS A GAME CHANGER</p>
        <h1 class="unlike">Unlike other sports that left me tired, <br> Kalari actually energized me!</h1>
        <p class="para">After intense morning practice sessions, I experienced a significant positive shift. <br> Unlike
            other sports that left me tired, Kalari actually energized me. </p>
        <p class="para">Those two hours of rigorous training granted me the stamina and strength <br> needed to carry
            out 6 to 8 kalari treatments effectively. </p>
        <p class="para">It was an absolute game-changer, being able to derive energy from the practice <br> rather than
            feeling exhausted by it.</p>

        <p class="game">AFTER HAVING LEARNED IT PROPERLY, <br>
            I COULDN’T KEEP IT TO MYSELF</p>
        <h1 class="unlike">I knew I had to share it with more people</h1>
        <p class="para">Kalari is not easily accessible to everyone, not even in India. And even among those who have
            access to it, it is mostly seen as just a martial art.</p>
        <p class="para">After experiencing my own transformation, I became determined to assist others in discovering
            the same within themselves.</p>
        <p class="para"> <b>My goal is to help them understand the Kalari Way of Life,</b> embrace it, and become the
            best versions of themselves.</p>
        <p class="para">Traditionally, Kalari students used to live with their master, immersing themselves in his way
            of life through constant observation. But when I started teaching students in Germany, I felt limited by the
            few hours of training we had each week. It wasn't enough to teach them the true essence of Kalari.</p>
        <p class="para">This made me even more determined to find a better, more efficient way to share the incredible
            transformation of Kalari. That's why I began breaking it down into fundamental steps.</p>
        <p class="step"><b>Step by step, I developed a system that enables anyone, regardless of their <br>location, to
                learn the Kalari Way of Life.</b> </p>
        <p class="text_str"><strong>It's not about spending hours practicing each day. <br>
                It's about making sustainable, small changes and adjustments to your lifestyle. <br> These changes
                transform the way you think, the way you feel, and ultimately, who <br> you become.
            </strong></p>
        <p class="para1 para">The martial art is just the beginning of the transformation. The system I created <br>taps
            into ancient wisdom, guiding us like a compass instead of strict rules.</p>
        <p class="para1 para">And today I am excited to announce that the "system" is ready for release.</p>
